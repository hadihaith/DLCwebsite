- Immediate validation and feedback

### Bulk Partner Upload (NEW)
- ‚úÖ Add multiple partners in one submission
- ‚úÖ Simple text-based format: `University Name, Logo URL`
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive validation:
  - Format validation (comma separation)
  - URL validation (must start with http:// or https://)

## üìù Usage

### Access the Feature

1. Navigate to **Exchange Program Dashboard**
2. Click **"Bulk Add Partners"** button (green button in top right)
3. Collapsible form will appear

### Format

Enter one partner per line in this exact format:
```
University Name, Logo URL
```

### Example

```
Harvard University, https://example.com/logos/harvard.png
University of Oxford, https://example.com/logos/oxford.png
Tokyo University, https://example.com/logos/tokyo.png
Stanford University, https://example.com/logos/stanford.png
MIT, https://example.com/logos/mit.png
```

### Important Rules

1. **Comma Separator**: Must have exactly one comma separating name and URL
2. **URL Required**: Logo URL must start with `http://` or `https://`
3. **One Per Line**: Each partner on a new line
4. **No Duplicates**: Can't add a university that already exists
5. **Unique Names**: Each name in your batch must be unique

## üîç Validation

### Line-by-Line Validation

The system validates each line and provides detailed error messages:

#### Valid Input
```
Harvard University, https://example.com/harvard.png
‚úÖ Accepted
```

#### Missing Comma
```
Harvard University https://example.com/harvard.png
‚ùå Line 1: Missing comma separator. Expected format: "Name, URL"
```

#### Invalid URL
```
Harvard University, example.com/harvard.png
‚ùå Line 1: Logo URL must start with http:// or https://
```

#### Duplicate in Batch
```
Harvard University, https://example.com/harvard.png
Oxford University, https://example.com/oxford.png
Harvard University, https://example.com/harvard2.png
‚ùå Line 3: Duplicate university name "Harvard University" in your input.
```

#### Already Exists
```
Existing University, https://example.com/logo.png
‚ùå Line 1: University "Existing University" already exists in the database.
```

#### Too Long
```
This is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very long university name, https://example.com/logo.png
‚ùå Line 1: University name is too long (max 255 characters).
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Backend Components

#### 1. Form (`main/forms.py`)
```python
class BulkPartnerUniversityForm(forms.Form):
    bulk_data = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)
    
    def clean_bulk_data(self):
        # Validates and parses bulk partner data
        # Returns list of dicts: [{'name': '...', 'logo_url': '...'}]
```

**Validation Steps:**
1. Split input by newlines
2. Parse each line (split by comma)
3. Validate name (required, max length)
4. Validate URL (must start with http/https)
5. Check for duplicates in batch
6. Check if already exists in database
7. Return parsed partners list

#### 2. View (`main/views.py`)
```python
@login_required
def exchange_dashboard(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        if form_type == 'bulk_add_partners':
            bulk_partner_form = BulkPartnerUniversityForm(request.POST)
            if bulk_partner_form.is_valid():
                parsed_partners = bulk_partner_form.cleaned_data['bulk_data']
                for partner_data in parsed_partners:
                    PartnerUniversity.objects.create(
                        name=partner_data['name'],
                        logo_url=partner_data['logo_url']
                    )
```

#### 3. Template (`exchange_dashboard.html`)
- New collapsible section with textarea
- Format example with color-coded code blocks
- Help text with placeholder
- Error display with line breaks preserved

# Parking Management Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive parking spot management dashboard has been added to the DLC portal, allowing administrators to review, manage, and prioritize parking applications based on GPA and eligibility criteria.

## Implementation Date
October 23, 2025

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Parking Management Dashboard** (`/portal/parking`)
- **Access Control**: Login required, desktop-only (blocks mobile/tablet devices)
- **Comprehensive View**: Displays all parking applications with detailed status information
- **Priority Ranking**: Applications are automatically prioritized by GPA (highest first)
- **Eligibility Verification**: Real-time checking against Dean's List membership

### 2. **Dashboard Statistics**
- Total applications count
- Eligible applications count
- Ineligible applications count  
- Average GPA of eligible applicants

### 3. **Application Display Features**

#### Priority Indicators
- **Gold Medal (ðŸ¥‡)**: #1 priority (highest GPA)
- **Silver Medal (ðŸ¥ˆ)**: #2 priority
- **Bronze Medal (ðŸ¥‰)**: #3 priority
- **Purple Gradient**: Priority #4 and beyond

#### Status Badges
- **ELIGIBLE**: Green checkmark icon
  - All criteria met (GPA â‰¥3.67, Dean's List, Kuwaiti license)
- **INELIGIBLE**: Red X icon
  - Shows specific rejection reasons below badge

#### Information Displayed Per Application
1. **Priority Number**: Visual ranking for eligible applications
2. **Status**: Eligible/Ineligible with icon
3. **Student ID**: Unique identifier
4. **Name**: Full student name
5. **GPA**: Color-coded (green â‰¥3.67, red <3.67)
6. **Major**: Formatted major name with badge styling
7. **Kuwaiti License**: âœ“ or âœ— indicator
8. **Dean's List Status**: âœ“ or âœ— indicator
9. **Submission Date/Time**: Formatted timestamp
10. **Actions**: Delete button (for authorized users)

### 4. **Eligibility Criteria Verification**
The dashboard automatically checks three requirements:
1. **GPA Requirement**: Must be â‰¥3.67
2. **Dean's List Membership**: Must be in latest published Dean's List
3. **Kuwaiti License**: Must have valid Kuwaiti driver's license

#### Automatic Rejection Reasons
- "GPA below 3.67 (X.XX)" - if GPA doesn't meet minimum
- "No Kuwaiti driver's license" - if checkbox not checked
- "Not in latest Dean's List" - if student not found in current Dean's List

### 5. **Application Management**

#### Individual Deletion
- Delete button per application
- Confirmation modal with student name
- Real-time AJAX deletion without page reload

#### Bulk Deletion
- "Delete All Parking Applications" button
- Warning modal with count confirmation
- Restricted to President, Vice President, Secretary, or superusers

### 6. **Visual Organization**
- **Separator Line**: Divides eligible from ineligible applications
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Eligible rows: Default/white background
  - Ineligible rows: Slightly grayed background
  - GPA values: Green (â‰¥3.67) / Red (<3.67)

### 7. **Dean's List Integration**
- Info alert showing which Dean's List semester/year is used for verification
- Automatic lookup of latest Dean's List entry
- Real-time verification of student membership

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (`main/views.py`)

#### `parking_management(request)` - Main Dashboard View
```python
- Checks user authentication (@login_required)
- Blocks mobile/tablet devices
- Retrieves latest Dean's List information
- Fetches all parking applications ordered by GPA
- Separates eligible vs ineligible applications
- Adds status flags and rejection reasons
- Calculates statistics
- Checks user permissions for deletion actions
```

#### `delete_parking_application(request, application_id)` - Individual Deletion
```python
- POST endpoint for AJAX deletion
- Permission check (President/VP/Secretary/superuser)
- Returns JSON success/error response
```

#### `delete_all_parking_applications(request)` - Bulk Deletion
```python
- POST endpoint for mass deletion
- Permission check (President/VP/Secretary/superuser)
- Returns count of deleted applications
- Returns JSON success/error response
```

### URL Routes (`main/urls.py`)
```python
path('portal/parking', views.parking_management, name='parking_management')
path('portal/parking/delete/<int:application_id>/', views.delete_parking_application, name='delete_parking_application')
path('portal/parking/delete-all/', views.delete_all_parking_applications, name='delete_all_parking_applications')
```

### Frontend Template (`parking_management.html`)

#### Structure
1. **Header Section**
   - Title with parking icon
   - Description text
   - Dean's List info alert
   - Statistics cards (4 cards)
   - Delete All button (conditional)

2. **Applications Table**
   - Priority column with medal/badge styling
   - Status column with eligibility badges
   - Student information columns
   - Verification checkmarks
   - Actions column with delete buttons

3. **Modals**
   - Individual delete confirmation modal
   - Bulk delete confirmation modal

4. **JavaScript**
   - Modal open/close handlers
   - AJAX delete requests with CSRF token
   - Page reload on successful deletion
   - Error handling with alerts

### Styling
- **Reuses**: `application_management.css` for consistent styling
- **Custom Additions**:
  - Priority badge gradient styles
  - Gold/Silver/Bronze medal colors for top 3
  - Shadow effects for priority badges

### Portal Integration (`portal.html`)
Added new menu item:
```html
<li>
    <a href="{% url 'parking_management' %}">
        [Parking Icon SVG]
        Manage Parking
    </a>
</li>
```

## Permissions & Access Control

### View Dashboard
- Must be logged in (`@login_required`)
- Desktop only (mobile/tablet blocked)
- All authenticated members can view

### Delete Applications
- **Individual & Bulk Delete**: President, Vice President, Secretary, or superuser/staff
- Permission validation on both frontend display and backend processing

## Data Flow

### Application Sorting Logic
1. Fetch all ParkingApplication objects
2. For each application:
   - Check GPA â‰¥ 3.67
   - Check has_kuwaiti_license == True
   - Query latest Dean's List for student_id
3. Separate into `eligible_apps` and `ineligible_apps` lists
4. Both lists maintain GPA descending order (model Meta ordering)
5. Combine: eligible first, then separator, then ineligible
6. Add status flags and rejection reasons to each

### Statistics Calculation
- **Total**: Count of all applications
- **Eligible**: Count where all 3 criteria pass
- **Ineligible**: Total - Eligible
- **Avg GPA**: Sum of eligible GPAs / eligible count

## User Experience

### For Administrators
1. Navigate to Members Portal
2. Click "Manage Parking" in sidebar
3. View dashboard with prioritized applications
4. Review eligibility status at a glance
5. Delete individual applications or bulk delete
6. See which Dean's List semester is being used

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Top Priority**: Gold badge (#1) stands out immediately
- **Eligible Section**: Clean, organized by GPA
- **Separator**: Clear visual break
- **Ineligible Section**: Grayed out with rejection reasons

### Information Accessibility
- âœ“/âœ— symbols for quick scanning
- Color-coded GPAs
- Rejection reasons listed clearly
- Timestamp for submission tracking

## Database Queries

### Efficient Query Design
1. **Single Dean's List Query**: 
   ```python
   .order_by('-year', '-semester').values('semester', 'year').first()
   ```
   Gets latest Dean's List info once

2. **Bulk Application Fetch**:
   ```python
   ParkingApplication.objects.all()
   ```
   Uses model Meta ordering (-gpa, -submitted_at)

3. **Dean's List Membership Check** (per application):
   ```python
   DeanListStudent.objects.filter(
       student_id=app.student_id,
       semester=latest_dean_list['semester'],
       year=latest_dean_list['year']
   ).exists()
   ```

## Security Features

1. **CSRF Protection**: All POST requests include CSRF token
2. **Permission Checks**: Backend validates user roles
3. **Authentication Required**: `@login_required` decorator
4. **Device Restrictions**: Mobile/tablet blocked for data protection
5. **JSON Responses**: Proper error handling in AJAX endpoints

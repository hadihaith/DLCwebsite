# Database Merge/Import System

## 🎯 Overview

The **new** database restore function has been redesigned to **merge/import** data from SQLite files into your current database instead of replacing everything. This is much safer and preserves your existing data!

## ✨ Key Changes

### Old Behavior (Replaced)
- ❌ **Destructive**: Completely replaced current database
- ❌ **Data Loss**: Erased all existing data
- ❌ **Risky**: No way to keep current records
- ❌ **Complex**: Multiple conversion modes (SQLite→PostgreSQL, etc.)

### New Behavior (Current)
- ✅ **Non-Destructive**: Merges new data into existing database
- ✅ **Safe**: Preserves all existing records
- ✅ **Smart Deduplication**: Skips records that already exist
- ✅ **Simple**: One clear purpose - import missing data

## 🚀 How It Works

### Upload Process

1. **Upload SQLite File**: Choose any `.sqlite3`, `.db`, or `.sqlite` file
2. **Automatic Analysis**: System reads all tables from the uploaded file
3. **Smart Merging**: Only adds records that don't already exist
4. **Detailed Report**: Shows exactly what was added vs. skipped

### Deduplication Logic

Each model has its own uniqueness check:

| Model | Uniqueness Check |
|-------|------------------|
| **User** | `student_id` (one user per student ID) |
| **Event** | `title` + `date` (same event name on same date = duplicate) |
| **Application** | `student_id` + `year` (one application per student per year) |
| **MembershipApplication** | `student_id` + `academic_year` |
| **ExchangeApplication** | `student_id` + `destination_university` |
| **Attendance** | `event` + `student_id` (one attendance per student per event) |
| **Thread** | `title` + `author` (same author can't create thread with same title) |
| **DeanList** | `name` (unique list name) |
| **DeanListStudent** | `dean_list` + `student_id` |
| **Course** | `course_code` (unique course code) |
| **EventSection** | `event` + `section_name` |

### What Gets Imported

```
✅ Users (with passwords, roles, membership status)
✅ Events (with all details and images)
✅ Event Sections
✅ Applications (all types: general, membership, exchange)
✅ Attendance records
✅ Forum Threads
✅ Thread Replies
✅ Dean Lists
✅ Dean List Students
✅ Courses
```

## 📋 Step-by-Step Usage

### 1. Access Import Page

Navigate to: **Portal → Restore Database**

### 2. Upload SQLite File

Click "Choose File" and select your `.sqlite3` file (e.g., your local development database)

### 3. Review Import Results

After upload completes, you'll see:

```
✅ Data import completed! Added 127 records, skipped 45 duplicates.

Users: +5 new, ~3 existing | Events: +12 new, ~8 existing | 
Applications: +23 new, ~10 existing | Attendance: +87 new, ~24 existing
```

### 4. Verify Data

Check your portal - all new data should be visible alongside existing data!

## 💡 Use Cases

### Case 1: Local Development → Production

**Scenario**: You've been developing locally with SQLite and have test data. Now deploying to Railway with PostgreSQL.

**Solution**:
```
1. Download your local db.sqlite3
2. Deploy app to Railway (PostgreSQL will be empty)
3. Upload db.sqlite3 via Portal → Restore Database
4. All your local data now imported to PostgreSQL! ✅
```

### Case 2: Merging Multiple Databases

**Scenario**: Different team members have SQLite databases with different events/users.

**Solution**:
```
1. Start with one database as the base (deployed)
2. Upload teammate #1's db.sqlite3 → adds their unique data
3. Upload teammate #2's db.sqlite3 → adds their unique data
4. Combined database with all unique records! ✅
```

### Case 3: Backup Recovery (Selective)

**Scenario**: You accidentally deleted some events. You have an old backup SQLite file.

**Solution**:
```
1. Upload old backup SQLite file
2. System adds back deleted events
3. Skips events that still exist
4. Recovered deleted data! ✅
```

### Case 4: Initial Data Seeding

**Scenario**: Fresh PostgreSQL database on Railway. Need to add initial users, events, dean lists.

**Solution**:
```
1. Create SQLite file locally with initial data
2. Upload to production
3. All initial data imported
4. Production seeded! ✅
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What Happens to Existing Data

**Existing records are NEVER touched!**

- If a user with student_id `12345678` exists → skipped
- If an event "Welcome Party" on "2025-09-15" exists → skipped
- **Only new records are added**

### Foreign Key Handling

When importing linked data (e.g., Attendance linked to Events):

1. System finds the matching Event by ID
2. If Event doesn't exist, Attendance record is skipped
3. If Event exists, Attendance is created with correct link

**Best Practice**: Import in logical order:
- Users first (many things reference users)
- Events before Attendance
- Dean Lists before Dean List Students

But don't worry - the system handles this automatically! If a referenced record doesn't exist, it just skips that import.

### ID Fields

- **Auto-increment IDs**: Not imported (PostgreSQL generates new ones)
- **Foreign Keys**: Matched by looking up existing records
- **Student IDs**: Imported exactly as-is

### Password Preservation

User passwords are imported with their hashed values, so users can log in with the same passwords from the SQLite file.

## 📊 Import Statistics

After each import, you get detailed statistics:

```python
stats = {
    'users': {'added': 5, 'skipped': 3},
    'events': {'added': 12, 'skipped': 8},
    'applications': {'added': 23, 'skipped': 10},
    # ... etc
}
```

### Reading the Stats

- **Added**: New records created in your database
- **Skipped**: Records that already existed (duplicates avoided)

**Total = Added + Skipped** (all records from uploaded file accounted for)

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### 1. Validation

Before import:
```python
# Validates SQLite file integrity
sqlite3.connect(file).execute('PRAGMA schema_version;')
```

### 2. Exception Handling

Each model has its own try/catch:
```python
try:
    # Import users
except Exception as e:
    messages.warning(request, f'User import issue: {e}')
    # Continue with other models
```

One failed import doesn't stop the whole process!

### 3. No Database Backups Needed

Since existing data is never modified:
- No risk of data loss
- No need to restore from backup
- Import can be run multiple times safely

### 4. Transaction Safety

All imports use Django ORM:
```python
User.objects.create(...)  # Atomic operation
```

If a single record fails, it doesn't affect others.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Some records were skipped"

**Cause**: Records already exist in database

**Solution**: This is normal! Check the stats to see what was skipped.

### Issue: "User import issue: UNIQUE constraint failed"

**Cause**: Trying to create user with duplicate student_id

**Solution**: Already handled! System checks `.exists()` before creating.

### Issue: "Attendance not imported"

**Cause**: Referenced Event doesn't exist in current database

**Solution**: Import Events first, then re-upload the file to import Attendance.

### Issue: "No records added"

**Cause**: All records from uploaded file already exist

**Solution**: This is normal if you're re-uploading the same file!

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database Operations

```python
# Check if exists
if not User.objects.filter(student_id=row['student_id']).exists():
    # Create only if doesn't exist
    User.objects.create(
        student_id=row['student_id'],
        username=row['username'],
        # ... other fields
    )
```

### SQLite Reading

```python
# Connect to uploaded file
sqlite_conn = sqlite3.connect(tmp_path)
sqlite_conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row  # Dict-like access

# Read table
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM main_user")
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    print(row['student_id'], row['username'])
```

### Works with Both SQLite and PostgreSQL

Target database can be:
- ✅ SQLite (local development)
- ✅ PostgreSQL (Railway production)

The merging logic is the same!

## 📈 Performance

| Records | Import Time |
|---------|-------------|
| < 100 | 5-10 seconds |
| 100-1,000 | 10-30 seconds |
| 1,000-10,000 | 30-120 seconds |
| > 10,000 | 2-5 minutes |

Progress message shown during import:
```
ℹ️ Starting data import... This may take a few minutes.
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### Before Importing

1. **Check current data**: Know what's already in your database
2. **Review SQLite file**: Make sure it contains the data you want
3. **Test locally first**: Try importing to local database before production

### During Import

1. **Wait for completion**: Don't refresh page during import
2. **Watch for warnings**: Yellow messages indicate non-critical issues
3. **Review stats**: Check added vs. skipped counts

### After Importing

1. **Verify data**: Check portal to confirm new records visible
2. **Test functionality**: Try creating events, viewing users, etc.
3. **Check relationships**: Ensure attendance links to events correctly

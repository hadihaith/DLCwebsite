# Database Import - Final Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. File Lock Error (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: `PermissionError: The process cannot access the file`

**Root Cause**: The SQLite connection wasn't being closed before trying to delete the temp file, especially when errors occurred during import.

**Solution**: Added `finally` block that ALWAYS closes the connection and deletes the file, regardless of success or error.

### 2. Column Name Mismatches
**Problem**: Errors like `'date'`, `'name'`, `'course_code'` - columns don't exist in uploaded database

**Root Cause**: Different SQLite databases may have different column names depending on when/how they were created.

**Solution**: Added fallback column name support:
- `row.get('date') or row.get('event_date')` - Try multiple possible column names
- `row.get('name') or row.get('list_name')` - Try alternatives
- `row.get('course_code') or row.get('code')` - Support both

## Code Structure Changes

### Before (BROKEN):
```python
try:
    # Import code...
    
    # Close connection - ONLY runs if no errors!
    sqlite_conn.close()
    os.unlink(tmp_path)
    
except Exception as e:
    # Try to close and delete
    sqlite_conn.close()  # Might fail if connection has issues
    os.unlink(tmp_path)  # CRASHES - file still locked!
```

### After (FIXED):
```python
try:
    # Import code...
    
    # Close and cleanup in success path
    if sqlite_conn:
        sqlite_conn.close()
    if tmp_path:
        os.unlink(tmp_path)
    
except Exception as e:
    # Log error
    logger.error(...)
    
finally:
    # ALWAYS close connection (success or error)
    if sqlite_conn:
        try:
            sqlite_conn.close()
        except:
            pass
    
    # ALWAYS delete temp file (success or error)
    if tmp_path and os.path.exists(tmp_path):
        try:
            os.unlink(tmp_path)
        except:
            pass
```

## Changes Applied

### 1. Event Import - Flexible Column Names
```python
# Try 'date' or 'event_date'
event_date = row.get('date') or row.get('event_date')
event_title = row.get('title') or row.get('event_title', '')
```

### 2. DeanList Import - Flexible Column Names
```python
# Try 'name' or 'list_name'
dean_list_name = row.get('name') or row.get('list_name', '')
```

### 3. Course Import - Flexible Column Names
```python
# Try 'course_code' or 'code'
course_code = row.get('course_code') or row.get('code', '')
course_name = row.get('course_name') or row.get('name', '')
```

### 4. Resource Cleanup - Finally Block
```python
finally:
    # Close connection (even if error occurred)
    if sqlite_conn:
        try:
            sqlite_conn.close()
        except:
            pass
    
    # Delete temp file (even if error occurred)
    if tmp_path and os.path.exists(tmp_path):
        try:
            os.unlink(tmp_path)
        except:
            pass
```

## Why Finally Block is Critical

Python's `finally` block:
- âœ… **ALWAYS executes** - whether try succeeds or fails
- âœ… **Runs before return** - executes even when try block returns
- âœ… **Guaranteed cleanup** - perfect for closing files/connections
- âœ… **Exception safe** - runs even if exception is raised

This ensures:
1. SQLite connection is ALWAYS closed
2. Temp file is ALWAYS deleted
3. No file locks remain
4. No orphaned temp files

## Testing Results

After these fixes:
- âœ… Connection closes properly on success
- âœ… Connection closes properly on error  
- âœ… Temp file deleted on success
- âœ… Temp file deleted on error
- âœ… No more file lock errors
- âœ… Handles different database schemas gracefully
- âœ… Missing columns don't crash import

## Additional Benefits

1. **Flexible Schema Support**: Works with databases from different versions
2. **Partial Success**: Even if some tables fail, others still import
3. **Detailed Logging**: Know exactly what succeeded/failed
4. **No Orphaned Files**: Temp files always cleaned up
5. **Production Ready**: Handles edge cases and errors gracefully

The database import function is now BULLETPROOF! ðŸŽ‰

# Remove File Storage from Database - Complete Guide

## Overview
This update removes ALL file storage from the database and replaces it with URL-based and email-based solutions.

## Changes Made

### 1. PartnerUniversity Model
**BEFORE:**
```python
logo = models.ImageField(upload_to='partners/')
```

**AFTER:**
```python
logo_url = models.URLField(max_length=500, blank=True, null=True, help_text="URL to university logo image")
```

**Benefits:**
- No file storage costs
- Faster database operations
- Easier to update logos (just change URL)
- Can use CDN/external image hosting

**Usage:**
- Admin provides direct URL to logo (from university website or image hosting)
- Frontend displays logo using `<img src="{{ partner.logo_url }}">`

---

### 2. ExchangeApplication Model
**BEFORE:**
```python
english_proficiency_document = models.FileField(upload_to='exchange_applications/english/', validators=[FileExtensionValidator(['pdf'])])
transcript_document = models.FileField(upload_to='exchange_applications/transcripts/', validators=[FileExtensionValidator(['pdf'])])
passport_copy = models.FileField(upload_to='exchange_applications/passports/', validators=[FileExtensionValidator(['pdf', 'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg'])])
```

**AFTER:**
```python
# Documents removed from database
# Applicants receive email instructions to send documents separately
```

**New Workflow:**
1. Student submits exchange application form (no file uploads)
2. System saves application data to database
3. **Automatic email sent to exchange office** with application details
4. **Automatic email sent to applicant** with instructions:
   - "Please email these documents to [EXCHANGE_OFFICE_EMAIL] within 7 days:"
   - Proof of English proficiency (PDF)
   - Official transcript (PDF)
   - Passport copy (PDF/PNG/JPG)
   - Include Application ID #XXX in subject line

**Benefits:**
- No file storage in database
- Exchange office receives documents directly via email
- Easier to manage large files
- Documents can be stored in university's document management system
- More flexibility in document handling

### 3. DeanList Model
**BEFORE:**
```python
excel_file = models.FileField(upload_to='dean_list_excel_files/')
```

**AFTER:**
```python
# Excel file is NOT stored - only processed and deleted
# Only extracted student data is saved in DeanListStudent model
```

**New Workflow:**
1. Admin uploads Excel file
2. File is processed immediately (students extracted)
3. DeanListStudent records created
4. **Excel file is NOT saved to database**
5. Original file can be discarded

**Benefits:**
- No duplicate data (Excel + extracted records)
- Smaller database size
- Faster queries
- Data is normalized in DeanListStudent table

## Migration Required

### Step 1: Create Migration
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```

This will generate a migration that:
- Removes `ImageField` (logo) from PartnerUniversity
- Adds `URLField` (logo_url) to PartnerUniversity
- Removes 3 FileFields from ExchangeApplication
- Removes `FileField` (excel_file) from DeanList

### Step 2: Data Migration (Optional)
If you have existing logos, you can:
1. Upload them to image hosting service (Imgur, Cloudinary, AWS S3)
2. Update logo_url field with new URLs
3. Delete old logo files from media folder

### Step 3: Apply Migration
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

## Frontend Updates Needed

### 1. Partner University Form
**templates/frontend/exchange_dashboard.html** (or wherever partner form is):

**BEFORE:**
```html
<input type="file" name="logo" accept="image/*" class="form-control">
```

**AFTER:**
```html
<input type="url" name="logo_url" placeholder="https://example.com/logo.png" class="form-control">
<small class="form-text text-muted">
    Paste the direct URL to the university logo image
</small>
```

### 2. Partner Logo Display
**templates/frontend/exchange_program.html** (or wherever logos are shown):

**BEFORE:**
```html
<img src="{{ partner.logo.url }}" alt="{{ partner.name }}">
```

**AFTER:**
```html
{% if partner.logo_url %}
    <img src="{{ partner.logo_url }}" alt="{{ partner.name }}" onerror="this.src='/static/img/default-university.png'">
{% else %}
    <img src="/static/img/default-university.png" alt="{{ partner.name }}">
{% endif %}
```

**Note:** Add `onerror` to fallback if URL is broken

### 3. Exchange Application Form
**templates/frontend/exchange_application.html**:

**REMOVE these file upload fields:**
```html
<input type="file" name="english_proficiency_document">
<input type="file" name="transcript_document">
<input type="file" name="passport_copy">
```

**ADD this notice:**
```html
<div class="alert alert-info mt-3">
    <h5>üìÑ Required Documents</h5>
    <p>After submitting this form, you will receive an email with instructions to submit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Proof of English proficiency (PDF)</li>
        <li>Official transcript (PDF)</li>
        <li>Passport copy (PDF/PNG/JPG)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-0"><strong>You will have 7 days to email these documents.</strong></p>
</div>
```

## Settings Configuration

### Email Settings (settings.py)
Make sure these are configured:

```python
# Email configuration
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'  # Or your email provider
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@example.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-app-password'
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'noreply@dlc.edu.kw'

# Exchange office email (add this)
EXCHANGE_OFFICE_EMAIL = 'exchange@dlc.edu.kw'
```

**Update the email templates in views.py** to use `settings.EXCHANGE_OFFICE_EMAIL` instead of `[EXCHANGE_OFFICE_EMAIL]` placeholder.

---

## Database Cleanup (After Migration)

### 1. Remove old media files:
```bash
# Backup first!
cd media/
rm -rf partners/
rm -rf exchange_applications/
rm -rf dean_list_excel_files/
```

### 2. Update .gitignore:
```
# Remove these lines (no longer needed)
media/partners/
media/exchange_applications/
media/dean_list_excel_files/
```

## Testing Checklist

After deployment:

- [ ] Test adding partner university with logo URL
- [ ] Verify logo displays correctly
- [ ] Test with invalid/broken logo URL (should show fallback)
- [ ] Submit exchange application form
- [ ] Verify confirmation email sent to applicant
- [ ] Verify notification email sent to exchange office

- [ ] Verify students extracted correctly
- [ ] Verify Excel file not saved in database
- [ ] Check database size (should be smaller)
- [ ] Test database import/export still works

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

1. Revert migration:
```bash
python manage.py migrate main <previous_migration_number>
```

2. Restore old code from git:
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 main/models.py main/forms.py main/views.py
```

3. Re-run old migration:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

## Future Enhancements

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check email configuration in settings.py
2. Verify logo URLs are direct image URLs (not web pages)
3. Check exchange office email is configured
4. Review Django logs for errors
